# Brute Force via SSH Log Analysis Lab

## Objective

This project aims to deepen my understanding of brute-force attacks, particularly those targeting SSH. My primary goals include:
- Gaining a clear understanding of how account compromise via brute-force attacks occurs
- Reinforcing my knowledge of Linux commands commonly used in security analysis through practical application
- Learning how to identify indicators of brute-force activity in log files and recognize real-time attack patterns
- Exploring key post-compromise behaviors such as privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, and command execution
- Understanding how SSH is leveraged during brute-force attacks and the role it plays in initial access

### Skills Learned

- Strengthened my proficiency with Linux command-line tools used in security investigations
- Developed the ability to identify brute-force attack patterns through log file analysis
- Gained hands-on experience recognizing SSH-based brute-force behavior and its role in account compromise
- Improved my understanding of how attackers escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and execute commands post-compromise
- Became more confident navigating and analyzing logs in a Linux environment
- Became more familiar with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, including how to locate specific sub-techniques relevant to observed attacker behavior

### Tools Used

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and native Linux commands for log navigation, parsing, and forensic analysis
- MITRE ATT&CK framework website for mapping observed behaviors to specific techniques and sub-techniques
- ipinfo.io for IP address enrichment and basic open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering
